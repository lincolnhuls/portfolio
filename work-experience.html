                    During my time in high school, I was able to work in several different industries. I worked for Wendyâ€™s, which helped me learn
                    the soft skills of good teamwork to accomplish goals in a restricted amount of time. I worked for a local landscaping company, 
                    which helped me build my skills with effective communication with leadership and effective planning of time. We had a large 
                    property that we covered, and we were in close contact with the managers to let them know about any issues that might have 
                    arisen, as well as our progress across the property. Shortly after graduating, I was able to work as a tutor in an elementary 
                    school, which again helped me to build skills with management, as I was always working closely with the teacher that I was 
                    aiding. Following that, I was able to serve a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. This experience 
                    greatly helped me to grow in many of my soft skills, including working with a partner, team, and organization, as well as 
                    adapting to needs and solving problems quickly. After returning home I was able to return to the elementary school and work as 
                    a substitute teacher, which has helped me become more flexible, and able to solve problems with given information very quickly.
