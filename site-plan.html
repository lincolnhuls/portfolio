      <p>
        I am from Ammon, Idaho, where I have lived since I was born in 2003. I love everything about technology, and also greatly enjoy music. Most of my time is spent programming, learning about new, developing technologies, or listening to or writing music. I have loved learning my entire life and am continuing my pursuit to learn by attending Brigham Young University-Idaho. In my high school experience, I worked hard to achieve a high level of education, taking many dual credit and advanced placement classes. This allowed me to be a Summa Cum Laude graduate, and offered a great launch into my college experience. I started my college experience by pursuing a degree in Physics with a specialty in astronomy, but because of a canceled class, I took an intro to programming class as a filler. I found a passion for programming, and in due course decided to switch from Physics to a more programming focused major. Now I am currently working towards a degree in the Computer Science field, and hope to learn in part to be a full stack developer, along with knowledge in the machine learning field.

      <h3>Work Experience</h3>
      <p>
        During my time in high school, I was able to work in several different industries. I worked for Wendy’s, which helped me learn the soft skills of good teamwork to accomplish goals in a restricted amount of time. I worked for a local landscaping company, which helped me build my skills with effective communication with leadership and effective planning of time. We had a large property that we covered, and we were in close contact with the managers to let them know about any issues that might have arisen, as well as our progress across the property. Shortly after graduating, I was able to work as a tutor in an elementary school, which again helped me to build skills with management, as I was always working closely with the teacher that I was aiding. Following that, I was able to serve a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. This experience greatly helped me to grow in many of my soft skills, including working with a partner, team, and organization, as well as adapting to needs and solving problems quickly. After returning home I was able to return to the elementary school and work as a substitute teacher, which has helped me become more flexible, and able to solve problems with given information very quickly.

      <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
      <p>
        My projects have stemmed primarily from the assignments that I have received in class that I have grown past the expected requirements. The first one of these was a program that was built to take an input and deliver an output in response. This was utilized to make an ‘Adventure Game’. The original standard could be completed within just a few lines of programming, but over the next few weeks I turned it into a several hundred line program, with extra features to check input answers and a test delay response to make the program more immersive. This required a lot of extra research, and a lot of extra time and work. My other big project that I am working on right now is a website that I am creating to combine database creation and manipulation, python background, and web design development. The end goal is to have a website that will allow a user to register for an account or sign in, and allow them to create a catalog of cards used in a popular game. This project is outside of the scope of my current classes, so I am taking it on with a ton of research and a lot of extra work. I am loving the process and the learning that is happening because of it.
