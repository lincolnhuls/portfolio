                My projects have stemmed primarily from the assignments that I have received in class that I have grown past the expected 
                requirements. The first one of these was a program that was built to take an input and deliver an output in response. 
                This was utilized to make an ‘Adventure Game’. The original standard could be completed within just a few lines of programming, 
                but over the next few weeks I turned it into a several hundred line program, with extra features to check input answers and a 
                test delay response to make the program more immersive. This required a lot of extra research, and a lot of extra time and work.

                My other big project that I am working on right now is a website that I am creating to combine database creation and 
                manipulation, python background, and web design development. The end goal is to have a website that will allow a user to 
                register for an account or sign in, and allow them to create a catalog of cards used in a popular game. This project is outside 
                of the scope of my current classes, so I am taking it on with a ton of research and a lot of extra work. I am loving the process 
                and the learning that is happening because of it.
