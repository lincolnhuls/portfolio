                        I am from Ammon, Idaho, where I have lived since I was born in 2003. I love everything about technology, and also greatly
                        enjoy music. Most of my time is spent programming, learning about new, developing technologies, or listening to or 
                        writing music.

                    I have loved learning my entire life and am continuing my pursuit to learn by attending Brigham Young University-Idaho. 
                    In my high school experience, I worked hard to achieve a high level of education, taking many dual credit and advanced 
                    placement classes. This allowed me to be a Summa Cum Laude graduate, and offered a great launch into my college experience.
                    I started my college experience by pursuing a degree in Physics with a specialty in astronomy, but because of a canceled 
                    class, I took an intro to programming class as a filler. I found a passion for programming, and in due course decided to 
                    switch from Physics to a more programming focused major. Now I am currently working towards a degree in the Computer Science
                    field, and hope to learn in part to be a full stack developer, along with knowledge in the machine learning field.
